# Microdi-js

Microdi-js is a tiny but feature rich dependency injection container for JavaScript.

# Basic usage

## Object Registration 
You can register an object using one of three methods:

* `container.register(identifier, Item)`.

  This registers either a constructor function OR an object prototype `Item` using the given string `identifier`.

  You can chain calls to alter the registration settings:
  
  ```javascript
    var identifier = 'itemKey1';
    container
        .register('identifier', Item)
        .inject('otherDependencyIdentifier1', 'otherDependencyIdentifier1')
        .singletonPerContainer()
        .inGroup('mySimilarObjects');
  ```

  Here we register `Item` using the string `identifier`. 
  We state that it requires [dependencies](#dependencies) `otherDependencyIdentifier1` and `otherDependencyIdentifier1`. 
  It's [lifetime management](#lifetime-management) is `singletonPerContainer`.
  It can be resolved using the `identifier` or as part of the [group](#resolve-groups) `mySimilarObjects`. 
  
* `container.registerInstance(identifier, objectInstance)`.

  You can use `registerInstance` to register an existing instance with the given string `identifier`.
    
* `container.registerFactory(identifier, factory)`.

  This registers a creation factory using the given string `identifier`. 
  The factory is a function that must return a new object instance. 
  The factory will receive the current container as a first parameter.
  Any additional arguments passed during the `resolve` call will be passed to the factory.
  
  ```javascript
    container
        .registerFactory('fooId', (container, ...additionalDependencies) => {
              let fooDependency = container.resolve('fooDependencyId');  
              return new Foo(fooDependency, ...additionalDependencies);
        })
        .transient();
    
    let foo = container.resolve('fooId', 1, 2, 3);
  ```
  
  Here we register a factory that will resolve a `Foo`. 
  We then resolve an instance (`foo`) passing some additional arguments. 
  Our creation factory resolves an additional dependency, then passes this dependency, plus the additional dependencies `1, 2, 3` to `Foo`s constructor and returns it.
  It's registered using a transient scope so each time you resolve it, the factor will be invoked to resolve a new `Foo` instance. 

## Object Resolution

Object resolution is done via :

* `container.resolve(identifier [, additionalDependency1, additionalDependency2, etc. ]);`

  This simply builds the object registered with the given `identifier`. 
  Any dependencies will also be built and injected.
  Optionally provide additional dependencies which will get passed in after any that were specified via `inject()` at registration time.
  
* `container.resolveGroup(name);`

   Resolving a [group](#resolve-groups) returns an array of objects registered against that group. 
 
## Example

Below we have 2 simple classes. 
`Parent` takes `Child` as it's dependency. 
`Child` is registered with the identifier 'child' and `Parent` with the identifier 'parent'.
Additionally the parent registration injects the `Child` as a [dependency](#dependencies).

``` javascript
class Child {
    sayHello() {
        console.log('Hello from the child');
    }
}
class Parent {
    constructor(child) {
        this._child = child;
    }
    sayHello() {
        console.log('Hello from the parent');
        this._child.sayHello();
    }
}
var container = new microdi.Container();
container.register('child', Child);
container.register('parent', Parent).inject('child');
var parent = container.resolve('parent');
parent.sayHello();
```

Output:

```
keith@devshop:~/dev/personal/microdi-js/dist/examples$ node readme.js
Hello from the parent
Hello from the child
```

# Concepts

## Identifiers

JavaScript doesn't have a type system which makes containers a little cumbersome to use. 
Typically in typed languages you'd utilise information provided by the type system to aid in dependency resolution and injection.
However without such a system all is not lost, we can simply use strings (i.e. 'identifiers') to identify objects to construct.

## Dependencies
We need to manually specify objects dependencies at registration time. 
This is because there are no means available to inspect arguments required for `constructors` or `init` methods at object instantiation/initialisation time.
We specify dependencies via `inject`:

```javascript
container.register('a', A)
         .inject(dependency1, dependency2, etc.);`
```

Each item passed to `inject` represents a dependency to be injected into the instance that will be build.
During `resolve` dependencies will be passed to the new instance in the same order they were provided to `inject`.
The arguments to `inject` can contain string `identifiers` referencing other registrations and/or `resolverKey`s.
A `resolverKey` references a [dependency resolver](#dependency-resolvers) which adds functionality to how the container will acquire and build the dependency.

Lets look at an example:

```javascript
class Controller { 
    constructor(a, factoryThatMakesB) {}
}
container.register('a', A);
container.register('b', B);
container
    .register('controller', Controller)
    .inject('a', { resolver: 'factory', key : 'b' });
```

The above registers a `Controller` using the identifier `controller`.
It specifies `Controller` requires 2 dependencies:

* The dependency registered as `a`.
* The dependency `{ resolver: 'factory', key : 'b' }`, this is a `resolverKey` telling the container to build the dependency `b` using the build in [injection factory](#injection-factories) resolver.

# Features

## Object creation & dependency injection

A call to `resolve` will trigger build up of the object in question. 
Any [dependencies](#dependencies) the object requires will be resolved and injected.

### Function constructors

If the type registered is a constructor function (i.e. typeof registeredObject === 'function') it will be initialised accordingly and any [dependencies](#dependencies) passed in.

### Prototypical inheritance

If the type registered is not a constructor function it will be assumed a prototype.
At resolve time new object/s will be created using Object.create(registeredObject).
If the object has an `init` method then this will be called passing any [dependencies](#dependencies).

## Lifetime management

An objectâ€™s lifetime can be controlled by the container in a number of ways.

### Singleton

A singleton registration specifies the container will hold onto the object instance.
Multiple calls to `resolve` with the same key will yield the same instance.
When the container is disposed, the container will, for any registered instances with a `dispose` function, invoke that function.


```javascript
var Foo = {};
container.register('theFoo', Foo).singleton();
var foo1 = container.resolve('theFoo');
var foo2 = container.resolve('theFoo');
console.log(foo1 == foo2); // true
```

Note this is the default lifetime used and so the call to `.singleton()` is optional.

### Singleton per container

This is similar to a singleton however you get a single instance per child container.

```javascript
var Bar = {};
container.register('theBar', Bar).singletonPerContainer();
var bar1 = container.resolve('theBar');
var bar2 = container.resolve('theBar');
var childContainer = container.createChildContainer();
var bar3 = childContainer.resolve('theBar');
var bar4 = childContainer.resolve('theBar');
console.log(bar1 == bar2); // true
console.log(bar2 == bar3); // false
console.log(bar3 == bar4); // true
```

### Transient

This creates a new instance each time a call to `resolve(identifier)` or `resolveGroup(groupName)` is made.
The container will not hold a reference to the instances created.

```javascript
var Baz = {};
container.register('theBaz', Baz).transient();
var baz1 = container.resolve('theBaz');
var baz2 = container.resolve('theBaz');
console.log(baz1 == baz2); // false
```

### External

Like a singleton however the container won't dispose the object when it's disposed.

```javascript
var Disposable = {
    init() {
        this.isDisposed = false;
        return this;
    },
    dispose() {
        this.isDisposed = true;
    }
};
// Note registerInstance internally sets the lifetime type as 'external', 
// You can pass false as the last argument if you want to change this. 
// The container will then manage it as 'singleton' and dispose the instance at disposal time 
container.registerInstance('disposable1', Object.create(Disposable).init());
container.register('disposable2', Disposable);
var disposable1 = container.resolve('disposable1');
var disposable2 = container.resolve('disposable2');
container.dispose();
console.log(disposable1.isDisposed); // false
console.log(disposable2.isDisposed); // true
```

## Resolve groups

You can group objects together at registration time then resolve them using `resolveGroup(name)`.
Typically this is handy when you're objects share a related abstraction.

```javascript
var Foo = {
    name: "theFoo"
};
var Bar = {
    name: "theBar"
};
var container = new microdi.Container();
container.register('foo', Foo).inGroup('group1');
container.register('bar', Bar).inGroup('group1');
var group1 = container.resolveGroup('group1');
for (let i = 0, len = group1.length; i < len; i++) {
    console.log(group1[i].name);
}
```

Output:

```
theFoo
theBar
```

### Injecting groups

If you want to inject a group simply register the injection using the `groupName`.
From example, if you wanted to inject all dependencies in group `group1`, from our example above, you'd do this:

```javascript
class Bazz {
    constructor(group1) {
        // group1 would be an array with dependencies 'foo' and 'bar'
        this._group1 = group1;
    }
};
container.register('bazz', Bazz).inject('group1');
var bazz = container.resolveGroup('bazz');
```

## Resolution with additional dependencies

When calling `resolve` you can optionally pass additional [dependencies](#dependencies).
These will be appended to the dependencies provided to `inject` at registration time (if any).

```javascript
class Foo {
    constructor(fizz, bar, bazz) {
        console.log('%s %s %s', fizz.name, bar.name, bazz.name);
    }
}
var container = new microdi.Container();
container.register('fizz', { name: 'fizz'});
container.register('foo', Foo).inject('fizz');
var foo = container.resolve('foo', { name: 'bar'}, { name: 'bazz'});
```

Output

```
fizz bar bazz
```

## Injection factories

Sometimes you want your object to receive a factory, that when called will `resolve` and return the dependency in question.

```javascript
class Item {
    constructor() {
        console.log("creating an item");
    }
}
class Manager{
    constructor(itemFactory) {
        this._itemFactory = itemFactory;
    }
    createItem(name) {
        return this._itemFactory(name);
    }
}
var container = new microdi.Container();
container.register('item', Item).transient();
container.register('manager', Manager).inject({ resolver: 'factory', key: 'item'});
var manager = container.resolve('manager');
var item1 = manager.createItem();
var item2 = manager.createItem();
```

output:

```
creating an item
creating an item

```

> **Note**
>
> Injected factories are different from factories you use to create objects (via `container.registerFactory`). 
> A factory registered via `registerFactory` is simply used to create your instance. 
> An injected factory lets the container create the instance but it wraps this creation in a factory and injects the factory. 
> It's typically used for lazy resolution of objects or when an object needs to create many other objects but doesn't want to take a dependency on the container itself. 

### Additional dependencies in factories

You can pass arguments to the factory and they forwarded as discussed [above](#resolution-with-additional-dependencies).

Lets modify the sample from above to demonstrate this:

```javascript
class Item {
    constructor(otherDependencyA, name) {
        console.log('Hello ' + name + '. Other dependency: ' + otherDependencyA);
    }
}
class Manager{
    constructor(itemFactory) {
        this._itemFactory = itemFactory;
    }
    createItem(name) {
        return this._itemFactory(name);
    }
}
var container = new microdi.Container();
container.registerInstance('otherDependencyA', 'look! a string dependency');
container.register('item', Item).inject('otherDependencyA').transient();
container.register('manager', Manager).inject({ resolver: 'factory', key: 'item'});
var manager = container.resolve('manager');
var fooItem = manager.createItem('Foo');
var barItem = manager.createItem('Bar');
```

output:

```
Hello Bob
Hello Mick
```

## Child containers

Child containers can be used to manage and scope a set of related objects.
They inherit configuration from the parent however can be re-configured.
They also inherit instances from their parent depending upon the lifetime management of the objects in question. 

Create a child container by calling `createChildContainer` on a parent;
```javascript
var container = new microdi.Container();
var childcontainer = container.createChildContainer();
```

### Lifetime management in child containers

Depending upon registration configurations, objects resolved from a child container will either be owned by the child container or the parent.

```javascript
var Foo = { };
var container = new microdi.Container();
var childContainer = container.createChildContainer();
container.register('foo', Foo); // defaults to singleton registration
var foo1 = container.resolve('foo');
var foo2 = childContainer.resolve('foo');
console.log(foo1 == foo2); // true, same instance

container.register('fooAgain', Foo).singletonPerContainer();
var foo3 = container.resolve('fooAgain');
var foo4 = childContainer.resolve('fooAgain');
console.log(foo3 == foo4); // false, different instance
var foo5 = childContainer.resolve('fooAgain');
console.log(foo4 == foo5); // true, same instance
```

### Overriding Registrations

The configuration of a child container can be overridden if required.

```javascript
var Foo = { };
var container = new microdi.Container();
container.register('foo', Foo); // defaults to singleton registration

var childcontainer = container.createChildContainer();
childcontainer.register('foo', Foo).transient();

var foo1 = container.resolve('foo');
var foo2 = container.resolve('foo');
console.log(foo1 == foo2); // true, same instance

var foo3 = childcontainer.resolve('foo');
console.log(foo2 == foo3); // false, different instance

var foo4 = childcontainer.resolve('foo');
console.log(foo3 == foo4); // false, different instance
```

Output:

```
true
false
false
```

## Resolving the container

Sometimes you have an object that requires the container to be injected. 
While often thought of as an anti pattern, there are scenarios where this makes sense. 
If the object is a 'bootstrapper' of sorts, i.e. it needs fine grained control over child containers and sub object graph resolution, injecting a container makes sense. 
  
When there are child containers at play, you'd expect objects who require a container, to be provide with the same container that build them, i.e. the child container in question. 
 
Lets look at an example:

```javascript
// a class that takes a container as a dependency
class Bootstrapper {
    constructor(container) {
        this._container = container; 
    }
}
```

Lets look at the manual way of doing this:

```javascript
import { Container } from 'microdi-js'; 
var container = new Container();
container.registerInstance('theRootContainer', container);
container.register('bootstrapper', Bootstrapper).inject('theRootContainer');
// bootstrapper will get injected with instance `container`
let bootstrapper = container.resolve('bootstrapper');
```

This will work, but when there are child container at play it gets a bit messy as you have to register things manually each time a child is created.
Typically you strive to keep child container re-configuration to a minimum for code maintainability reasons. 

microdi supports a special injection key exposed as `MicroDiConsts.owningContainer`.
This key will ensure an object getting resolved get it's owning container.
Lets re-work the above example:

```javascript
import { Container, MicroDiConsts } from 'microdi-js'; 
var container = new Container();
container
    .register('bootstrapper', Bootstrapper)
    .inject(MicroDiConsts.owningContainer);
// bootstrapper will get injected with instance `container`
let bootstrapper = container.resolve('bootstrapper');
```

Objects injected with `MicroDiConsts.owningContainer` and resolved from child containers will get the owning child container injected: 

```javascript
import { Container, MicroDiConsts } from 'microdi-js'; 
var container1 = new Container();
container1
    .register('bootstrapper', Bootstrapper)
    .transient() // resolve new `Bootstrapper` instance each time
    .inject(MicroDiConsts.owningContainer);

// bootstrapper1 will get injected with `container1`
let bootstrapper1 = container1.resolve('bootstrapper');

// bootstrapper2 will get injected with `container2`
let container2 = container1.createChildContainer();
let bootstrapper2 = container2.resolve('bootstrapper');
```

## Checking what's registered

You can check if a dependency is registered using `.isRegistered(name)`.
A group can be checked using `.isGroupRegistered(groupName):boolean`.
Both these exist on a `container` object and will return a boolean result. 

## Disposal

When you call `.dispose()` on a container, that container will inspect any object it holds and if an object has a `dispose` function, it will be called.
However it will not dispose transient-created objects or objects registered via `registerInstance('aKey', myInstance)`.
Any child containers created from the disposed parent will also be disposed.  These child containers will in turn dispose of their registered instances.

```javascript
class Foo {
    dispose() {
        console.log('foo disposed');
    }
}

var container = new microdi.Container();

container.register('foo', Foo).singletonPerContainer();
var foo1 = container.resolve('foo');

var childcontainer = container.createChildContainer();
var foo2 = childcontainer.resolve('foo');

container.dispose();
```

Output:

```
foo disposed
foo disposed
```

## Dependency Resolvers

Dependency resolvers alters the default way a dependency is created.
A dependency resolver is simply an object with a `resolve(container, resolverKey)` method.
You can create your own resolvers and add them to the container.
When registering an object, a `resolverKey` can be used as a [dependency](#dependencies).
This enables the container to resolve the dependency using the resolver specified.
A `resolverKey` can can also be specified as a replacement for the object or construction function that is to be built.
At resolve time the container will call the dependency resolver specified by the `resolverKey` to create the object in question.
The `container` and the `resolverKey` specified via `inject()` will be passed to the resolvers `resolve` method.
This sounds a bit more complicated than it actually is, it's easier to demonstrate with some code.

Here is an example where rather than registering a concrete object to build, a `resolverKey` is used.
The `DomResolver` resolver will be used to resolve the object.

```javascript
class DomResolver {
    resolve(container, resolverKey) {
        // return a pretend dom element,
        return {
            get description() {
                return 'Fake DOM element - ' + resolverKey.domId ;
            }
        };
    }
}
var container = new microdi.Container();
container.addResolver('domResolver', new DomResolver());
// Note the usage of 'isResolverKey' so the container can distinguish this from a normal object.
// This is only required when you don't register a constructor function or prototype.
container.register('view', { resolver: 'domResolver', domId : 'theDomId', isResolverKey: true });
var view = container.resolve('view');
console.log(view.description);
```

Output:

```
Fake DOM element - theDomId

```

Here is an example where a concrete object is registered and a resolverKey is used to resolve a dependency of the registered item.

```javascript
class DomResolver {
    resolve(container, resolverKey) {
        // return a pretend dom element,
        return {
            get description() {
                return 'Fake DOM element - ' + resolverKey.domId ;
            }
        };
    }
}
var container = new microdi.Container();
container.addResolver('domResolver', new DomResolver());
class Controller {
    constructor(view) {
        console.log(view.description);
    }
}
// Note we don't need to specify the 'isResolverKey' property on the resolverKey.
// The container assumes it is as it appears in the dependency list.
container.register('controller', Controller).inject({ resolver: 'domResolver', domId : 'viewId' });
var controller = container.resolve('controller');
```

Output:

```
Fake DOM element - viewId
```

### Built in resolvers
There are 3 built in resolvers.

#### Delegate

The `delegate` resolver simply defers object creation to a delegate provided by the `resolverKey`.

```javascript
class Foo  {
    constructor(bar) {
        console.log('bar is : [%s]', bar);
    }
}
var container = new microdi.Container();
container.register('foo', Foo)
    .inject(
    {
        resolver: 'delegate',
        resolve: (container, resolveKey) => {
            return 'barInstance';
        }
    });
var foo = container.resolve('foo');
```

Output:

```
bar is : [barInstance]
```

#### Injection factory

Discussed [above](#injection-factories), injection factories use the `factory` dependency resolver to wrap the creation call in a function for later invocation.

#### External factory

Under the covers `registerFactory` uses a built in `externalFactory` dependency resolver to invoke the factory registered against an identifier.

## Annotation usages and IoC

Often container implementation use [decorators](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators/blob/caf8f28b665333dc39293d5319fe01f01e3e3c0f/README.md) (annotations in Java and attributes in C#) to decorate objects with IoC related concerns. 
For example lifetime management, scoping, dependency information etc.
The author believes this to be useful in some instances however often an anti-pattern for the following reasons:
* Objects become dependent on their dependencies as they are explicitly declared together.
* It becomes difficult to configure an object for differing usages unless you decorate it for both, if supported.
* It becomes difficult to gain an understanding of how objects play together at runtime.
  Runtime configuration is scattered on objects in different code files and across the entire codebase.
  Runtime configuration of objects is simpler to understand when it's in a single place.
* 90% of the time you'll find you need some runtime configuration. 
  You end up in a place where you have both runtime and declarative (i.e. decorator) configuration.
  This adds confusion.
* It doesn't work when creating shared code, i.e. in libraries. 
  If you hit this you don't want some code using annotation and some using run time configuration (i.e. the above point).
